# MAPDB_Project
# Analysis of Covid-19 papers

This distributed computing project will be focused on the analysis of 1000 papers about
COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. The dataset is a sub-sample of 1000
items taken from the original dataset that is composed of more than 75000 (and still
growing) papers. This dataset is a part of real-world research on COVID-19 named
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19). The research and related challenges are available on the dedicated page on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/alleninstitute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge
